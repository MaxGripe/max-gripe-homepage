# The benefits of RTO

Enforcing RTO (Return to Office) will lead to your best employees leaving the company. They can and will find other jobs. The ones who stay will be the worst employees, those who obediently return to the office but will now be unhappy with their work.

RTO is a subtle way to force hidden layoffs in a company if the goal is to cut staff and reduce the budget. However, it is the worst possible method.

There is, however, one benefit to RTO. When you announce it, employees get a clear message that the company is run by complete idiots. Undoubtedly, this is valuable information.

I have encountered such ideas before, and people tried to convince me that the goal was integration, creating a TEAM, and fostering a positive atmosphere. If you don't understand that many (though not all) employees simply DO NOT WANT to work in an office and you force them to do something against their will, you are a complete fool.
